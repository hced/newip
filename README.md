# newip

This is a simple macOS terminal command that will renew your Wi-Fi network IP address.

## Usage

Download or clone this repo and then `cd` into its directory. Then `chmod +x newip` in order to make it executable.

If you want it to be possible to run globally, you need to copy it (or link it to) your `$PATH`: either e.g. `cp ./newip /usr/local/bin` or `ln -s ./newip /usr/local/bin`.
